To use the geoflow tool in Python for automating multiple 3D building reconstructions in loops, you can leverage Python's `subprocess` module to run shell commands directly from a script. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Install Geoflow**: Ensure that you have Geoflow installed and available in your system's PATH. You can also use Docker to run the tool.

2. **Prepare Input Data**: Organize your point cloud files and 2D footprints to provide as input. If you have multiple files to process, consider creating a list or mapping between footprint files and point cloud files.

3. **Create the Configuration and Flowchart**: Each 3D reconstruction requires parameters to be passed to Geoflow. You can either use command-line arguments or a TOML config file for this purpose.

4. **Python Script**: Write a Python script to iterate over the input data and invoke the Geoflow commands using `subprocess`.

Here is an example Python script:

```python
import subprocess
import os

# Example directory paths (adjust based on your setup)
input_footprints_dir = "/path/to/footprints"
input_pointclouds_dir = "/path/to/pointclouds"
output_dir = "/path/to/output"
geoflow_path = "lod22-reconstruct"  # Make sure this is the correct command

# Example list of pairs for footprints and point clouds (adjust based on your data)
building_data = [
    {"footprint": "building_1.gpkg", "pointcloud": "building_1.las"},
    {"footprint": "building_2.gpkg", "pointcloud": "building_2.las"},
    # Add more pairs as needed
]

# Ensure output directory exists
os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)

# Function to run Geoflow for a single building
def reconstruct_building(footprint, pointcloud, output_folder):
    command = [
        geoflow_path,
        f"--input_footprint={footprints_dir}/{footprint}",
        f"--input_pointcloud={pointclouds_dir}/{pointcloud}",
        f"--output_cityjson={output_folder}/{footprint.split('.')[0]}.json",
        f"--output_ogr={output_folder}/{footprint.split('.')[0]}.gpkg",
        f"--output_obj_lod12={output_folder}/{footprint.split('.')[0]}_lod12.obj",
        f"--output_obj_lod13={output_folder}/{footprint.split('.')[0]}_lod13.obj",
        f"--output_obj_lod22={output_folder}/{footprint.split('.')[0]}_lod22.obj",
    ]
    subprocess.run(command, check=True)

# Iterate over building data and run reconstruction
for building in building_data:
    footprint_file = building["footprint"]
    pointcloud_file = building["pointcloud"]
    output_folder = os.path.join(output_dir, footprint_file.split(".")[0])
    os.makedirs(output_folder, exist_ok=True)

    try:
        reconstruct_building(footprint_file, pointcloud_file, output_folder)
        print(f"Successfully reconstructed {footprint_file}")
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Error during reconstruction of {footprint_file}: {e}")
```

### Notes:
- Replace the directory paths and file names with your specific paths.
- Ensure that the command is correct, especially if using Docker or if the tool isn't in your PATH.
- The `check=True` flag will raise an exception if the command fails.

By running this Python script, you'll be able to generate multiple 3D building models in an automated fashion.

Yes, the Geoflow tool can run in a Docker container as described in the documentation. The container allows you to isolate the dependencies and configurations required for the tool to work correctly.

### Adjusting the Python Script for Docker
If you want to run the tool through a Docker container, the main difference is that you'll need to modify the Python script to issue Docker commands instead of directly calling Geoflow. Here's a version of the script that uses Docker:

```python
import subprocess
import os

# Docker image and paths
docker_image = "geoflow3d/lod22-reconstruct:latest"
host_input_footprints_dir = "/path/to/footprints"  # Host path for footprints
host_input_pointclouds_dir = "/path/to/pointclouds"  # Host path for point clouds
host_output_dir = "/path/to/output"  # Host path for output
docker_input_dir = "/data"  # Container input directory (mounted)
docker_output_dir = "/data/output"  # Container output directory (mounted)

# Example list of pairs for footprints and point clouds (adjust based on your data)
building_data = [
    {"footprint": "building_1.gpkg", "pointcloud": "building_1.las"},
    {"footprint": "building_2.gpkg", "pointcloud": "building_2.las"},
    # Add more pairs as needed
]

# Ensure the output directory exists
os.makedirs(host_output_dir, exist_ok=True)

# Function to run Geoflow in a Docker container for a single building
def reconstruct_building_docker(footprint, pointcloud, output_subdir):
    command = [
        "docker", "run", "--rm",
        "-v", f"{host_input_footprints_dir}:{docker_input_dir}",
        "-v", f"{host_input_pointclouds_dir}:{docker_input_dir}",
        "-v", f"{host_output_dir}:{docker_output_dir}",
        docker_image,
        "--input_footprint", f"{docker_input_dir}/{footprint}",
        "--input_pointcloud", f"{docker_input_dir}/{pointcloud}",
        "--output_cityjson", f"{docker_output_dir}/{output_subdir}/{footprint.split('.')[0]}.json",
        "--output_ogr", f"{docker_output_dir}/{output_subdir}/{footprint.split('.')[0]}.gpkg",
        "--output_obj_lod12", f"{docker_output_dir}/{output_subdir}/{footprint.split('.')[0]}_lod12.obj",
        "--output_obj_lod13", f"{docker_output_dir}/{output_subdir}/{footprint.split('.')[0]}_lod13.obj",
        "--output_obj_lod22", f"{docker_output_dir}/{output_subdir}/{footprint.split('.')[0]}_lod22.obj",
    ]
    subprocess.run(command, check=True)

# Iterate over the building data and run reconstruction
for building in building_data:
    footprint_file = building["footprint"]
    pointcloud_file = building["pointcloud"]
    output_folder = footprint_file.split(".")[0]
    os.makedirs(os.path.join(host_output_dir, output_folder), exist_ok=True)

    try:
        reconstruct_building_docker(footprint_file, pointcloud_file, output_folder)
        print(f"Successfully reconstructed {footprint_file}")
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Error during reconstruction of {footprint_file}: {e}")
```

### Key Adjustments:
1. **Docker Paths**: Adjust the mounting paths (`-v` arguments) to correctly link your host paths to the container paths.
2. **Docker Image**: Ensure that the `docker_image` variable references the correct image for Geoflow.

By using Docker, you maintain consistency across different environments and ensure that all dependencies required for Geoflow are available.

If you're planning to use Geoflow on an HPC (high-performance computing) cluster, building it from source directly on a Linux system can offer a few advantages:

1. **Compatibility**: HPC environments typically have specialized configurations, and some are configured differently than standard desktop/server setups. Building from source ensures that the software is tailored to your specific environment, making it easier to align with available system libraries, hardware architecture, and dependencies.

2. **Performance Optimization**: By compiling from source, you can take advantage of compiler optimizations specific to your system's CPU and libraries, potentially improving runtime performance.

3. **Environment Modules**: Many HPC systems use environment modules to load specific dependencies and versions. Building from source allows you to choose compatible versions of each dependency.

4. **Resource Management**: You may have specific resource constraints or need to run the software within a batch job manager like SLURM. Compiling directly gives you greater control over integration with these resource management systems.

### Building from Source Instructions

1. **Dependencies**: First, ensure that all the required dependencies are available. You may need to install developer tools like `gcc`, `make`, and `cmake`, as well as the specific Geoflow submodule dependencies. Check the README of the repository for a comprehensive list.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/geoflow3d/geoflow-bundle.git
   ```

3. **Create Build Directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir geoflow-bundle/build && cd geoflow-bundle/build
   ```

4. **Configure with CMake**:
   ```bash
   cmake ..
   ```

5. **Build**:
   ```bash
   cmake --build . --config Release --parallel 4
   ```

   Adjust the `--parallel` value based on the available cores on your system.

6. **Install**:
   ```bash
   cmake --install .
   ```

### Considerations:

- **Environment Modules**: If your HPC uses modules, consider creating a module file for the custom-built software for easy loading/unloading.
- **Containerization**: Some HPC environments also support containers. If container execution is supported, you can leverage Docker or Singularity images to maintain portability.

This way, you should have a tailored version of Geoflow that aligns well with your HPC environment, potentially giving you better performance and more control over execution.

To set up Geoflow for an HPC environment using Singularity from translated Docker images and SLURM job scheduling, follow these steps:

### 1. Understanding Your HPC Environment
- **Login**: Access your HPC through SSH using MobaXterm or any terminal of your choice.
- **Gather Information**:
  - **System Info**: Check your HPCâ€™s operating system and version.
    ```bash
    uname -a
    ```
  - **Modules**: List available software modules if the system uses them.
    ```bash
    module avail
    ```
  - **GCC/Compiler Version**: Identify available GCC or other compilers.
    ```bash
    gcc --version
    ```
  - **GPU and SLURM Details**: Verify the GPU availability and SLURM configuration. For SLURM partition details:
    ```bash
    sinfo -s
    ```

### 2. Building Geoflow
- **Install Dependencies**: Make sure the required dependencies (compiler, CMake, libraries) are available. You can also load the relevant software modules.
  ```bash
  module load gcc cmake # Example modules
  ```
- **Build Geoflow**: Follow the steps for building from source:
  ```bash
  git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/geoflow3d/geoflow-bundle.git
  mkdir geoflow-bundle/build && cd geoflow-bundle/build
  cmake ..
  cmake --build . --config Release --parallel 4
  cmake --install .
  ```

### 3. Using Singularity and Docker Images
- **Install/Load Singularity**: Check if Singularity is available as a module or install it.
  ```bash
  module load singularity  # Example
  ```
- **Download Docker Image**: If using a Docker image, download it to a local system with Docker. Save the Docker image as a `.tar` file.
  ```bash
  docker pull geoflow3d/lod22-reconstruct:latest
  docker save geoflow3d/lod22-reconstruct:latest -o geoflow_image.tar
  ```
- **Build Singularity Image**:
  - Transfer the `.tar` file to the HPC.
  - Convert the Docker image to a Singularity image:
    ```bash
    singularity build geoflow_image.sif docker-archive://geoflow_image.tar
    ```
- **Run Jobs with SLURM**:
  - Create a SLURM batch file (`geoflow_job.sh`):
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    #SBATCH --job-name=geoflow_job
    #SBATCH --partition=gpu_partition
    #SBATCH --gres=gpu:1
    #SBATCH --time=01:00:00
    #SBATCH --output=geoflow_output.log

    singularity exec geoflow_image.sif lod22-reconstruct --input_footprint=path/to/footprint.gpkg --input_pointcloud=path/to/pointcloud.las --output_directory=/output/dir
    ```
  - Submit the job to SLURM:
    ```bash
    sbatch geoflow_job.sh
    ```

### Summary:
1. Gather HPC system information and load any relevant modules.
2. Build Geoflow from source or translate the Docker image to Singularity.
3. Create and submit a SLURM job using a Singularity image.

This ensures you can run Geoflow efficiently with access to GPU resources using SLURM and Singularity.

In the HPC environment with SLURM, Singularity, and Geoflow, you can use Python scripts to automate 3D reconstruction and create digital twins. Here's how you could approach this:

### 1. Python Integration in SLURM
Python can be used to dynamically generate SLURM job scripts, manage data, and handle results. It can also issue SLURM commands directly via `subprocess`.

### 2. Outline for the Process
1. **Input Data Management**: Organize your point clouds and footprint files for each building or object.
2. **Python Script**:
   - Create SLURM job scripts.
   - Invoke the jobs via `sbatch`.
   - Manage and monitor the output results.

### 3. Example Python Script
This script dynamically creates SLURM job files for each set of input data and submits them using `sbatch`.

```python
import os
import subprocess

# Paths to input data
footprints_dir = "/path/to/footprints"
pointclouds_dir = "/path/to/pointclouds"
output_dir = "/path/to/output"
singularity_image = "/path/to/geoflow_image.sif"
slurm_partition = "gpu_partition"  # Adjust this to your partition
gpu_gres = "gpu:1"  # Adjust the number/type of GPUs required
job_time = "01:00:00"  # Set the appropriate time limit

# Example data pairs
building_data = [
    {"footprint": "building_1.gpkg", "pointcloud": "building_1.las"},
    {"footprint": "building_2.gpkg", "pointcloud": "building_2.las"},
    # Add more pairs as needed
]

# Ensure output directory exists
os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)

# Function to create a SLURM job file and submit it
def create_and_submit_job(footprint, pointcloud, output_subdir):
    # Paths
    output_path = os.path.join(output_dir, output_subdir)
    os.makedirs(output_path, exist_ok=True)
    job_file_path = f"slurm_job_{output_subdir}.sh"

    # SLURM script template
    job_script = f"""#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=geoflow_{output_subdir}
#SBATCH --partition={slurm_partition}
#SBATCH --gres={gpu_gres}
#SBATCH --time={job_time}
#SBATCH --output={output_path}/output.log

    --input_footprint={footprints_dir}/{footprint} \\

    --output_ogr={output_path}/{footprint.split('.')[0]}.gpkg \\
    --output_obj_lod12={output_path}/{footprint.split('.')[0]}_lod12.obj \\
    --output_obj_lod13={output_path}/{footprint.split('.')[0]}_lod13.obj \\
    --output_obj_lod22={output_path}/{footprint.split('.')[0]}_lod22.obj
    """

    # Write and submit the job
    with open(job_file_path, "w") as job_file:
        job_file.write(job_script)

    # Submit the job
    try:
        subprocess.run(["sbatch", job_file_path], check=True)
        print(f"Successfully submitted job for {footprint}")
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Error submitting job for {footprint}: {e}")

# Iterate over each building pair and submit a job
for building in building_data:
    footprint_file = building["footprint"]
    pointcloud_file = building["pointcloud"]
    output_folder = footprint_file.split(".")[0]

    create_and_submit_job(footprint_file, pointcloud_file, output_folder)
```

### Key Points:
1. **Dynamic Job Creation**: Adjust job parameters like GPUs, time, and partitions based on the HPC setup.
2. **Monitoring**: Consider adding a monitoring mechanism to check the status of SLURM jobs (e.g., using `squeue`).

### Additional Tips:
- If your data changes often or the parameters need adjustments, it's a good idea to keep them configurable via JSON or environment variables.
- If possible, consider parallel processing by submitting multiple SLURM jobs simultaneously or grouping them by batch dependencies.

Using Python with SLURM gives you flexibility to scale digital twin generation efficiently.

The JSON configuration you've provided is a flowchart with nodes and global parameters used for reconstructing 3D buildings. In an HPC environment, you would typically:

1. **Prepare Python Wrapper**: Write a Python script to dynamically modify or pass global parameters and run the Geoflow reconstruction in loops with Singularity.

2. **Set Up SLURM Jobs**: Ensure SLURM batch files are dynamically created and submitted based on input parameters.

### Python Script Example
Here's a Python script that leverages the JSON flowchart configuration you've shared to handle multiple jobs dynamically:

```python
import json
import os
import subprocess

# Base paths
footprints_dir = "/path/to/footprints"
pointclouds_dir = "/path/to/pointclouds"
output_dir = "/path/to/output"
singularity_image = "/path/to/geoflow_image.sif"
slurm_partition = "gpu_partition"  # Adjust to your SLURM partition
gpu_gres = "gpu:1"  # Adjust the number/type of GPUs required
job_time = "01:00:00"  # Adjust based on job requirements

# Example data pairs
building_data = [
    {"footprint": "building_1.gpkg", "pointcloud": "building_1.las"},
    {"footprint": "building_2.gpkg", "pointcloud": "building_2.las"},
    # Add more pairs as needed
]

# Function to modify the JSON template and write a specific configuration
def create_flowchart_json(base_template, output_json_path, footprint, pointcloud, output_subdir):
    base_template["globals"]["input_footprint"][2] = f"{footprints_dir}/{footprint}"
    base_template["globals"]["input_pointcloud"][2] = f"{pointclouds_dir}/{pointcloud}"
    base_template["globals"]["output_cityjson"][2] = f"{output_subdir}/model.json"
    base_template["globals"]["output_ogr"][2] = f"{output_subdir}/model_2d.gpkg"
    base_template["globals"]["output_obj_lod12"][2] = f"{output_subdir}/model_lod12.obj"

def create_and_submit_slurm_job(output_subdir, flowchart_json):
    output_path = os.path.join(output_dir, output_subdir)

    job_file_path = f"slurm_job_{output_subdir}.sh"

    job_script = f"""#!/bin/bash

    with open(job_file_path, "w") as job_file:

    try:
        subprocess.run(["sbatch", job_file_path], check=True)
        print(f"Successfully submitted job for {output_subdir}")
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Error submitting job for {output_subdir}: {e}")

# Load the base JSON template
with open("base_flowchart.json", "r") as f:
    base_template = json.load(f)

# Iterate over each building data and submit jobs

    footprint_file = building["footprint"]
    pointcloud_file = building["pointcloud"]
    output_folder = footprint_file.split(".")[0]
    output_subdir = os.path.join(output_dir, output_folder)

    # Generate custom flowchart JSON
    flowchart_json = os.path.join(output_subdir, "reconstruction.json")
    create_flowchart_json(base_template, flowchart_json, footprint_file, pointcloud_file, output_subdir)

    # Create and submit the SLURM job
    create_and_submit_slurm_job(output_folder, flowchart_json)
```

### Summary:
1. **Read Base Template**: The script reads a base JSON flowchart configuration and modifies global parameters for each reconstruction job.
2. **Create and Submit Jobs**: A unique SLURM job script is created for each set of building data, which uses the modified flowchart JSON.
3. **Adaptation**: Customize SLURM partitions, job time, and GPU settings to suit your HPC environment.

This approach ensures that each building reconstruction job has its unique parameters while automating submissions via SLURM.

To identify the exact `OGRWriter` node that writes to `.gpkg` and provide the line numbers, I would need to inspect the actual JSON file provided in the `single` folder. I'll outline the approach step-by-step so you can do this effectively:

### Locate `OGRWriter` in `single`
1. **Open the Single JSON File**:
   - Find and open the JSON file in the `single` directory using a text editor (like VS Code or Sublime Text).

2. **Search for `OGRWriter`**:
   - Use the search function in your editor to find all instances of `"OGRWriter"` in the JSON file.

3. **Identify Relevant Nodes**:
   - Find the node that includes `"gdaldriver": "GPKG"` to confirm that it's writing to `.gpkg`.

### Example Code Excerpt
Assuming the node is named `OGRWriter-LoD11`, here's what it may look like in the file (with estimated line numbers):

```json
{
  "nodes": {
    "OGRWriter-LoD11": {
      "marked_inputs": {
        "attributes": false,
        "geometries": false
      },
      "parameters": {
        "CRS": "EPSG:7415",
        "create_directories": true,
        "do_transactions": false,
        "filepath": "output/single_building.gpkg",
        "gdaldriver": "GPKG",
        "layername": "LoD11",
        "overwrite_file": false,
        "overwrite_layer": false,
        "require_attributes": true,
        "transaction_batch_size_": 1000
      },
      "position": [4540.0, -246.0],
      "type": ["io-gdal", "OGRWriter"]
    }
  }
}
```

4. **Locate the Line Number**:
   - Note the line number where the `OGRWriter` node begins. You can see the exact start and end lines once you find this node in the editor.

### Integrate into the `batch` JSON
1. **Find Where to Place the Node**:
   - Locate the `nodes` section in the `batch` JSON file.
   - Determine where other output nodes are placed, so you can position the new `OGRWriter` node logically.

2. **Add an `OGRWriter` Node**:
   - Copy the node from the `single` JSON file to the `batch` JSON file, ensuring the `"filepath"` and `"layername"` values are adjusted for batch output.

3. **Connect Inputs**:
   - Ensure the new `OGRWriter` node receives appropriate inputs (`attributes` and `geometries`) from the previous nodes in the batch flowchart.

### Final Testing
- After modifying the `batch` JSON, test the changes by processing a dataset to ensure `.gpkg` files are created correctly.

When handling multiple consecutive buildings using a batch process, they can either be written to a single `.gpkg` file as separate layers or stored within the same layer with unique feature identifiers. This depends on your processing logic and requirements.

### Writing Two Consecutive Buildings
- **Single GeoPackage**: The two buildings can be added to the same `.gpkg` file, typically in a single layer with unique identifiers or in separate layers.
- **Separate GeoPackages**: You can also have each building written to a separate `.gpkg` file.

### Example JSON with Consecutive Buildings
Let's write two consecutive buildings into the same `.gpkg` file:

```json
{
  "nodes": {
    "OGRWriter-Single": {
      "marked_inputs": {
        "attributes": false,
        "geometries": false
      },
      "parameters": {
        "CRS": "EPSG:7415",
        "create_directories": true,
        "do_transactions": false,
        "filepath": "output/buildings_consecutive.gpkg",
        "gdaldriver": "GPKG",
        "layername": "Consecutive_Buildings",
        "overwrite_file": false,
        "overwrite_layer": false,
        "require_attributes": true,
        "transaction_batch_size_": 1000
      },
      "type": ["io-gdal", "OGRWriter"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **`OGRWriter-Single`**:
   - The `filepath` parameter is set to a single `.gpkg` file (`buildings_consecutive.gpkg`).
   - The `layername` parameter uses `"Consecutive_Buildings"` to group the two consecutive buildings.
   - The `overwrite_file` is `false` to avoid overwriting existing buildings and add consecutive ones.

### Key Considerations:
1. **Unique Identifiers**:
   - Ensure each building has a unique identifier or feature property in the layer to distinguish between them.

2. **Separate Layers vs. Shared Layer**:
   - If you prefer separate layers, you can define two `OGRWriter` nodes with different `layername` parameters while sharing the same `filepath`.

3. **Feature Attributes**:
   - Make sure your process includes attributes for each building to identify and differentiate them.

**Final Testing**:
- Test the updated JSON to ensure that both buildings appear correctly in the `.gpkg` file.

If you have two building generation nodes preceding the `.gpkg` output, you would typically connect both nodes to a single `OGRWriter` to write the combined results into the GeoPackage file. The building nodes would process data and send their output to the `OGRWriter`.

### Example JSON:
Here's how you can represent two building generation nodes followed by a single `OGRWriter` node for the `.gpkg` file:

```json
{
  "nodes": {
    "BuildingNode1": {
      "marked_inputs": {
        "input_data": false
      },
      "marked_outputs": {
        "attributes": true,
        "geometries": true
      },
      "parameters": {
        "param1": "value1",
        "param2": "value2"
      },
      "position": [1000, 200],
      "type": ["building-reconstruction", "BuildingType1"]
    },
    "BuildingNode2": {
      "marked_inputs": {
        "input_data": false
      },
      "marked_outputs": {
        "attributes": true,
        "geometries": true
      },
      "parameters": {
        "param1": "value3",
        "param2": "value4"
      },
      "position": [1200, 200],
      "type": ["building-reconstruction", "BuildingType2"]
    },
    "OGRWriter-Buildings": {
      "marked_inputs": {
        "attributes": [
          ["BuildingNode1", "attributes"],
          ["BuildingNode2", "attributes"]
        ],
        "geometries": [
          ["BuildingNode1", "geometries"],
          ["BuildingNode2", "geometries"]
        ]
      },
      "parameters": {
        "CRS": "EPSG:7415",
        "create_directories": true,
        "do_transactions": false,
        "filepath": "output/consecutive_buildings.gpkg",
        "gdaldriver": "GPKG",
        "layername": "Consecutive_Buildings",
        "overwrite_file": false,
        "overwrite_layer": false,
        "require_attributes": true,
        "transaction_batch_size_": 1000
      },
      "position": [1400, 400],
      "type": ["io-gdal", "OGRWriter"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **BuildingNode1 and BuildingNode2**:
   - These represent two nodes processing individual buildings.
   - They produce the attributes and geometries for each building.

2. **OGRWriter-Buildings**:
   - This node collects attributes and geometries from both preceding building nodes.
   - Writes both buildings to a GeoPackage file in a single layer.

### Key Notes:
- Make sure each building node generates unique feature identifiers or attributes for differentiation.
- Ensure proper connections from both building nodes to the `OGRWriter` node.

Test this configuration to verify that both buildings are written correctly into a single GeoPackage layer.
